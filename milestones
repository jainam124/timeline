text: For thousands of years, farmers and breeders developed the knowledge of crossbreeding that forms the basis of our agricultural society. However, the rules governing the heredity of the desirable traits of animals and plants were not understood. Gregor Mendel, a Silesian (now part of the Czech Republic) meteorologist, used breeding experiments to study the heredity of the seven characteristics of pea plants, including the height, pod shape and color, seed shape and color, and flower position and color. He found that some traits of these plants are dominant, while others are recessive. In addition, he noticed that these dominant and recessive features could not go together; their “parents” had inherited them. He discovered that these results could be valid for all living species, and proposed the concept of “factors” that later become the “genes” in modern biology. Mendel is thus known as the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Monk-Garden-Genius-Gregor-Genetics/dp/0618127410">“father of modern genetics”</a>.
