 Frederick Griffith
>Text:
After the 1918 flu, governments worldwide scrambled to find vaccines that could prevent infectious diseases. Frederick Griffith, a bacteriologist, worked with two strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae to engineer a vaccine for pneumonia. Griffith set up a series of experiments, in which he would inject various combinations of S and R strain bacteria into mice. The S strain was virulent and the R strain was nonvirulent.<p>He found that when a mouse is injected only with the S strain, it would die of pneumonia. When injected with only the R strain, the mouse remained healthy. Griffith heated the S strain and injected it into the mouse, which would also remain healthy. Finally, he mixed a combination of heated S and R strain bacteria and injected it into a mouse. To his surprise, the mouse died of pneumonia. From his experiment, Griffith hypothesized that when the mix of the S and R strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae is heated, the dead S strain, used a chemical compound to transform the non-virulent R strain into the more virulent S form. Griffith could not fully explain his “transforming principle”, however, his famous experiment would set the foundation for researchers in the future. </p>
