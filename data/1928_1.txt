 Frederick Griffith
>Text:
After the 1918 flu, governments around the world scrambled to find vaccines that could stop infectious diseases. Frederick Griffith, a bacteriologist, was working with two strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae in order to find a vaccine for pneumonia. The S strain which is virulent and the R strain which is nonvirulent. Griffith set up a series of experiments, where he would inject various combinations of the S and R strain bacteria into mice. <p>He found that when a mouse is injected solely with the S strain, it would die of pneumonia. When injected with only the R strain, the mice would be perfectly healthy. He then heated up and injected the S strain and found the mouse to be perfectly healthy as well. Finally, he mixed a combination of heated S and R strain bacteria and injected it into a mouse. To his surprise, the mouse died of pneumonia. From his experiment, Griffith hypothesized that when the mix of S and R strain Streptococcus pneumoniae is heated, the dead S strain, using a chemical compound, was able to transform the non-virulent R strain into the more virulent S form. Griffith was unable to fully explain his “transforming principle”, however, his famous experiment would set the foundation for researchers in the future. </p>
