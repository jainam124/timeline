US President Clition and UK Prime minister Blair support free access to genome information
>Text:
Together, the President of the United States and the Prime Minister of the United kingdom agreed to grant the public free access to genome information that scientists all over the world contributed to. They had two fundamental ideas that they wanted the public to keep in mind whilst having this information at their disposal. For one, data to be shared as widely as possible. They also wanted the genetic technology to be open to private investigation.
