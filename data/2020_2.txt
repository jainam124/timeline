X chromosome sequenced in its entirety
>Text:
The gap-less telomere-to-telomere assembly of the first human chromosome is completed. The X chromosome was chosen over the Y chromosome, because many human diseases are linked to the X chromosome, including hemophilia and Duchenne muscular Dystrophy. The X chromosome was sequenced by Phillipy and Karen Miga at the University of California, Santa Cruz. The DNA sequence was procured from a special cell type with two identical X chromosomes before a computer program was used to assemble individual sequence segments. Due to the efforts of Miga's team, the largest remaining sequence gap, the centromere, was closed.
