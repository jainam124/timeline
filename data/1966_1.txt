Nirenberg, Khorona and Holley determine genetic code
>Text:
In the years leading up to 1966, scientists discovered the structure of DNA and revealed that it was the source of hereditary material. However, they could not explain how DNA, composed of only four nucleotides, could determine the composition of complex proteins consisting of more than twenty amino acids. Marshall Nirenberg conducted his “poly-U” experiment, where he used E. coli bacteria, test tubes containing amino acids, and synthetic RNA, to demonstrate that the uracil chain in the RNA was a messenger for directing protein synthesis. He had cracked the genetic code and would continue his work, discovering that the coding units for amino acids contained three nucleotides (codons). He deciphered all 64 combinations of RNA codons for the 20 amino acids. Marshall Nirenberg along with Har Gobind Khorana and Robert Holley were awarded a Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1968 for their work on interpreting the genetic code. Their work paved the way for interpreting the entire human genome later on.
