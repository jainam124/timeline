HGP human physical mapping achieved
>Text:
A detailed genomic map is crucial for identifying genes and developing a better understanding of its various structures. The original plan was to place markers for every 100,000 base pairs. However, a great deal of the human genome project was completed by 1995, earlier than expected.
