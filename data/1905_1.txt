Human inborn errors in metabolism
>Text:
Often, scientists were oblivious to the full dynamic of the metabolism. English scientist, Archibald Garrod, conducted research endeavours, in order to build a stronger understanding of our metabolism. Furthermore, he wanted to understand how inherited disorders such as alkaptonuria and albinism come to be. With the concept of Mendelian law in mind, Garrod was able to demonstrate the complexity of metabolism. He did this by proving the involvement of metabolites in normal pathways and how they may vary. Overall, Garrod found that inherited disorders are caused by a low amount or no of enzymes present in specific biochemical pathways.
