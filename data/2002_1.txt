Draft of version of rice genome sequence completed and published
>Text:
Two groups of researchers were able to fully sequence rice. They originally examined rice to have 43,000 to 63,000 genes however the number was significantly lower at around 38,000 genes. With the rice being sequenced scientists have been able to have rice grow in a variety of different climates and environments.
