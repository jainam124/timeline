The first draft sequence of mouse genome generated
>Text:
The publically funded Mouse Genome Sequencing Consortium pieced together the entire mouse genome and discovered that the sequence contains 30,000 genes with a 99% similarity to the human genome. This development has allowed other scientists to look for disease-causing genes in the mouse genome that can be attributed to both mouse and human genetic diseases.
