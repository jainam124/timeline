Discovery of the Law of Genetics
>Text:
For thousands of years, farmers and breeders had developed the knowledge of crossbreeding that formed the basis of our agricultural society. However, the mechanisms governing the heredity of traits passed down from parent to child were still unknown. Gregor Mendel, a Silesian (now part of the Czech Republic) meteorologist, used self-pollination breeding experiments to study the heredity of seven characteristics of pea plants, including height, pod shape and color, seed shape and color, flower position, and color. He found that some of these traits were dominant, while others were recessive. In addition, he noticed that these dominant and recessive features could not be inherited together in the same plant. He described that these "rules" could underlie the mechanisms of heredity for most living species, and proposed the concept of “factors”, that later become “genes” in modern biology. Mendel is thus known as the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Monk-Garden-Genius-Gregor-Genetics/dp/0618127410">“father of modern genetics”</a>.
