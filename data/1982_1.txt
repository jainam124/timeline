Genbank database established
>Text:
Prior to the 1980s, before the discovery of the Genbank database, researchers were not able to stretch their research and knowledge to the fullest capability due to the fact that the sequencing information created by other scientists was not readily available. The Genbank database has allowed the public to have access to nucleotide sequencing for more than 300,000 varied organisms. The database receives information from labs all over the world.
