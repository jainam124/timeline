Maxan and Gilbert developed DNA sequencing methods
>Text:
Throughout the early 1970s, scientists were able to read/interpret genetic code, alongside the ability to read out the sequence of specific amino acids and proteins. However, researchers were still limited, they werenâ€™t able to read off nucleotide sequences approximately. Together, Allan Maxan and Walter Gilbert worked on developing techniques that could sequence DNA to this capacity. The recently named Gilbert-Maxam method, entailed the scientist carefully multiplying and divining DNA into distinct fragments. With these new techniques, DNA sequencing was faster and more efficient. The method made it possible to read nucleotide sequences for an entire gene.
