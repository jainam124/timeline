HGP completed and all goals achieved
>Text:
After 13 years, the Human Genome Project which began in 1990, was completed. The project was completed two years early and the cost was significantly lower than the expected budget. For the first time in our history, scientists were able to read the genetic blueprint of humans. The Human Genome Project provided the world with detailed information on the structure, organization and function of the entire set of human genes. However, this was not the only product from the Human Genome Project, humans developed newer technologies to study genomes and to sequence other model organisms.
