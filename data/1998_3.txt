RNA interference (RNAi) discovered by Andrew Fire and Craig Mello
>Text:
In 1998, two American scientists, Andrew Fire, and Craig Mello published a study that led them to win the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for that year. They discovered a fundamental mechanism, called RNA interference, that controls the flow of genetic information within the cell. RNA interference destroys mRNA molecules when they contain an identical sequence to existing double-stranded RNA molecules. This discovery could pave the way to technology that can silence genes related to human genetic diseases.
