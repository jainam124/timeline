PCR invented
>Text:
<p>The Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) was introduced in 1985 by Kary Mullis, as a result, he won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1993. This innovation was followed by significant breakthroughs in biotechnology. The development of PCR made it possible for research to be conducted on isolated fragments of DNA, which was often impractical before its invention. The technology made it feasible for researchers to create copies of a single strand of DNA at a low cost. The PCR machine first heats the template DNA until its double helix splits into 2 single strands. Afterward, an enzyme generates two new strands of DNA, using the two strands as templates. </p>This results in the formation of two new copies of the template DNA strand. This procedure is performed up to 40 times, resulting in one billion new copies of that DNA strand. This entire process takes one hour to complete. The machine is powered by another device called a thermocycler. This can be programmed to regulate the temperature of each reaction. Today, PCR is a common and popular technique used for many purposes and has been especially useful during the Coronavirus pandemic.
