PCR invented
>Text:
<p>The Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) was introduced in 1985 by Kary Mullis. The innovation has been followed by significant breakthroughs in the biotechnology industry, leading to Mullis winning a Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1993. The development of the PCR has made it feasible for research to be conducted on isolated fragments of DNA. This was virtually impractical prior to the invention. The technology has made it conceivable for researchers around the world to manufacture copies of a single strand of DNA at a low cost. The PCR machine initiates by heating the sample of DNA until it is separated into two distinct pieces. Afterwards, an enzyme generates two new strands of DNA, following the original strands as a sort of model. </p>This results in the formation of two new copies of that DNA. This procedure is performed up to 40 times, resulting in one billion new copies of that DNA. This entire process requires the PCR machine roughly one hour to complete. The machine is powered by another device called a thermocycler. This is able to be programmed in order to regulate the temperature of each reaction.  Today, scientists are seeking useful ways to apply PCR in their study to have innovative finding
