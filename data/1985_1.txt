PCR invented
>Text:
<p>The Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) was introduced in 1985 by Kary Mullis, as a result, he won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1993. The innovation has been followed by significant breakthroughs in biotechnology. The development of PCR has made it feasible for research to be conducted on isolated fragments of DNA, this was often impractical before its invention. The technology has made it conceivable for researchers around the world to create copies of a single strand of DNA at a low cost. The PCR machine initiates by heating the template DNA until its double helix breaks into 2 single strands. Afterward, an enzyme generates two new strands of DNA, following the original strands as a sort of model. </p>This results in the formation of two new copies of that DNA strand. This procedure is performed up to 40 times, resulting in one billion new copies of that DNA. This entire process takes roughly one hour to complete. The machine is powered by another device called a thermocycler. This is able to be programmed in order to regulate the temperature of each reaction. Today, PCR is a common and popular technique used for many purposes and has been especially useful during the Coronavirus pandemic.
