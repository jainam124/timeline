DNA is hereditary material
>Text:
The question of what causes us to inherit particular genes has baffled researchers for several years. Prior to 1944, scientists understood genes as a material that secretes enzymes that are responsible for various metabolic functions. Scientists Colin MacLeod, Maclyn MacCarty, and Oswald Avery discovered which segment of our cell provoked us to inherit particular genes and how they may influence the way we look. Collectively, the three researchers verified that DNA is the genetic material that causes bacterial transformation.<p> The group's discovery was based on Frederick Giffin's research. Their experiment, carried out in 1944, involved him injecting mice with 3s heat-killed Streptococcus pneumoniae cells and mixed them with lysate of type 2r cells and this resulted in lysate 3s cells. They noted that the substance permanently changed a nonpathogenic strain of the organism to a virulent strain. Together, Colin MacLeod, Maclyn MacCarty, and Oswald Avery rediscovered the work of Frederick Giffin. Moreover, they found that DNA was the genetic material that caused us to inherit genes. </p>
