DNA is the hereditary material
>Text: 
The mechanism behind the inheritance of phenotypic traits has intrigued scientists for many decades. Before 1944, scientists understood that genes are responsible for the creation of enzymes used to perform our various metabolic functions. Scientists Colin MacLeod, Maclyn MacCarty, and Oswald Avery discovered the segments of our cells that were responsible for the inheritance of particular phenotypic traits and their underlying genotypes. Collectively, the three researchers verified that DNA is the genetic material that causes bacterial transformation.<p> The group's discovery was based on Frederick Griffith's research. Their experiment, carried out in 1944, involved the injection of mice with 3s heat-killed Streptococcus pneumoniae cells, mixed with lysate of type 2r cells, to create lysate 3s cells. They noted that the substance permanently changed a non-pathogenic strain of the organism to a virulent strain. Together, Colin MacLeod, Maclyn MacCarty, and Oswald Avery rediscovered the work of Frederick Griffith. Moreover, they found that DNA was the genetic material that caused us to inherit traits from our parents. </p>
