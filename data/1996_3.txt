First archeal genome sequenced
>Text:
Before 1996, scientists believed that the only two branches of life were prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The sequencing of the jannaschii microorganism demonstrated the new branch of life, archaeal. The whole-genome random shotgun method was used in order to sequence the genome. Overall, the scientists were able to accurately predict the 1738 protein-coding sequence. Scientists found that this new group of life didn't have a nucleus like prokaryotes. However, archaeal has several different genes that vary from prokaryotes.
