First archaeal genome sequenced
>Text:
Prior to 1996, it was believed that there were only two branches of living organisms; prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The sequencing of the Jannaschii microorganism demonstrated a new branch of life, archaeal. The whole-genome random shotgun method was used in order to sequence the genome. Overall, researchers were able to accurately predict the 1738 protein-coding sequences. Scientists found that this new group of life lacked a nucleus like prokaryotes, but it did have several different genes that varied from prokaryotes.
