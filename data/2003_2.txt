The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project beings
>Text: 
The National Human Genome Research Insitute launched ENCODE to locate and list all of the functional components of the human genome. Information on protein-coding genes, RNA genes, regulatory components, and non-coding DNA found in human DNA was collected. The project was announced in September 2003 by the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), a corporation that funded the research groups from the United States that collaborated on the ENCODE project.
