First human disease gene mapped with DNA markers- Huntington's disease
>Text:
Huntington's disease is a neurodegenerative disease that affects the nervous system. Hundreds of people died from the disease before the location of the gene was found, and subsequently sequenced, making Huntington's disease the first disease to be mapped on the human genome. Physicians had little information about what caused the disease and how to diagnose it. As a result, scientists worked to establish a detailed gene map of the disease. Huntington's disease was the first disease to be linked to a specific chromosome, particularly chromosome 4p. In people with Huntington's disease, the codon CAG is replicated in a segment of the HTT gene. Conversely, patients with 6-35 CAG repeats are unlikely to develop Huntington's disease.
