The International HapMap Project sets out to develop a haplotype map
>Text:
The International HapMap Project launched a project to describe common patterns in haplotypes across human populations worldwide. Common patterns of DNA sequence variation were mapped and made publically available. DNA samples were taken from populations from Africa, Asia, and Europe. The HapMap project allowed for the discovery of sequence variations implicated in human diseases, aiding in our ability to correctly identify DNA sequences for treatments and interventions.
