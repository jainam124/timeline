Human Genome Organization founded
>Text:
Around this time, genome initiatives began in countries around the world. As a result, Sydney Brenner, a South African biologist and Nobel Prize winner, believed that there should be an organization in place to allow for international coordination in the field of genomics. In April of 1988, the Human Genome Organization was founded in Geneva, Switzerland. At the time of its founding, the established Founding Council consisted of 42 members, which now totals 200. The Human Genome Organisation strives to accomplish promotion of genetic research within nations and throughout the world, fostering scientific exchange in genomics (especially in developing countries), and discussing the ethics of genomics from a global perspective.
