Human genome organization founded
>Text:
Around this time, genome initiatives began in countries around the world. However, Sydney Brenner, a South African biologist and Nobel Prize winner believed that there should be an organisation in place to allow international coordination in the field of genomics. In April of 1988, the Human genome organization was founded in Geneva, Switzerland. At the time of its founding, the established Founding Council consisted of a total of 42 members, which has now grown to over 200. The main mission statements the Human genome organisation strives to accomplish are promoting genetic research within nations and throughout the world, fostering scientific exchange in genomics, especially in developing countries and discussing the ethics of genomics from a global perspective.
