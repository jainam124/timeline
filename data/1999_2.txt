Sequence of first human chromosomes completed
>Text:
At this point, scientists were able to fully sequence a human chromosome. The members from across the world that were part of the HGP, used the clone-by-clone method to help  decipher where exactly the location of a specific chromosome is. The first chromosome that was sequenced was chromosome 22. It became the longest DNA decoded and assembled. Further, the sequencing of the chromosomes resulted in the understanding of the chemical components of DNA. These included the major chemical building blocks, the letters A (adenine), T (thymine), G (guanine) and C (cytosine). They concluded that the arrangement of these letters determined our makeup, in terms of what we look like and what diseases we are most likely going to attract.
