 Erwin Chargaff works on pairing pattern 
>Text:
Avery’s discovery that DNA is the hereditary material was met with skepticism from most scientists. Many scientists at the time believed that the proportion of DNA’s bases did not vary, which meant that DNA did not have the variation to be genetic material. Upon hearing about Avery’s work, biochemist Erwin Chargaff dedicated his research to discovering more about DNA. Using paper chromatography and ultraviolet absorption, he isolated the four nitrogenous bases, then measured the quantity in the DNA sample. From his experiment, he made two key observations. He found that the proportions of bases vary depending on the species and more importantly, he found that the nitrogenous base pairs appear in a 1:1 ratio. Now known as Chargaff’s Rule, the ratio he found would later help Watson and Crick in the discovery of the structure of DNA.
