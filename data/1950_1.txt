 Erwin Chargaff works on pairing pattern 
>Text:
Avery’s discovery that DNA is a hereditary material was met with skepticism from most scientists. Many scientists at the time believed that genetic material could not be the cause of biodiversity, as the quantity of DNA bases does not fluctuate. Upon hearing about Avery’s work, biochemist Erwin Chargaff dedicated his research to discovering more about DNA. Using paper chromatography and ultraviolet absorption, he isolated the four nitrogenous bases and then measured the quantity in the DNA sample. From his experiment, he made two key observations. He found that the proportions of bases vary depending on the species and more importantly, he found that each nitrogenous base pair appears in an equal 1:1 ratio. Now known as Chargaff’s Rule, the ratio he found would later help Watson and Crick to describe the structure of DNA.
