Cohen and Boyer develop recombinant DNA technology
>Text:
Since 1959, scientists were familiar with “plasmids”, a DNA molecule found separated from chromosomal DNA, and by the early 1970s discovered enzymes termed endonucleases that could cleave specific portions of the plasmid. Although groundbreaking discoveries, scientists had not yet found the practical application of these discoveries. It would not be until medical researcher Stanley Cohen and biochemist Herbert Boyer worked together to demonstrate that they could artificially introduce modified DNA into a bacteria and it would replicate the foreign DNA naturally. <p>They set up an experiment where they modified a plasmid responsible for the resistance of the antibiotic tetracycline into E.Coli by cleaving a section using an endonuclease and inserting a gene conferring resistance to the antibiotic kanamycin. They discovered that the genetically modified colonies of E.Coli were resistant to both tetracycline and kanamycin, confirming that they successfully created a genetically modified organism capable of replicating the foreign DNA. Stanley Cohen and Herbert Boyer’s work jump-started the industry of biotechnology because the practical application of their r-DNA technology allowed for the low cost, high yield synthesis of substances such as Human Growth Hormone (HGH) and insulin. </p>
