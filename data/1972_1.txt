Cohen and Boyer develop recombinant DNA technology
>Text:
Plasmids have been known to science since 1959, they are a type of DNA molecule found inside bacteria and separate from the rest of its DNA. By the early 1970s scientists discovered enzymes called "endonucleases" that could cleave specific portions of a plasmid. Despite these groundbreaking discoveries, scientists had yet to find practical uses for this newfound knowledge. It would not be until medical researcher Stanley Cohen and biochemist Herbert Boyer collaborated to demonstrate that they could artificially introduce modified DNA into a bacteria to replicate the foreign DNA, by hijacking its cellular machinery. <p>The pair set up an experiment; they modified a plasmid responsible for the resistance of the antibiotic tetracycline into E. coli, by cleaving a section using an endonuclease and inserting a gene conferring resistance to the antibiotic kanamycin. They discovered that the genetically modified colonies of E. coli were resistant to both tetracycline and kanamycin, confirming that they successfully created a genetically modified organism capable of replicating the foreign DNA. Stanley Cohen and Herbert Boyerâ€™s work jump-started the biotechnology industry because the practical application of their rDNA technology allowed for the low-cost, high-yield synthesis of substances, such as Human Growth Hormone (HGH) and insulin. </p>
