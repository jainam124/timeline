Watson and Crick's discovery
>Text:
Before 1953, a comprehensive model of the structure of a DNA strand had yet to be built. Scientists required a detailed understanding of a three-dimensional model of the material. Collectively, British scientist James Watson and American scientist Francis Crick utilized Rosalind Franklin's image of DNA, captured using X-ray crystallography. Franklin's discovery that DNA had a helical conformation prompted Watson and Crick to propose the double-stranded helical model of DNA. Additionally, they discovered that DNA was made up of two chains of nucleotides and that nitrogenous bases can have several combinations. The double-helix model entailed that the two distinct polynucleotide chains spiraled around an imaginary axis to create a double helix, and the two chains ran in opposite directions.
