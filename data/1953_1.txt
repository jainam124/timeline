Watson and Crick's discovery
>Text:
Prior to 1953, a comprehensive model of the structure of a DNA strand had yet to be built. Scientists required a detailed understanding of a three-dimensional model of the material. Collectively, British scientist James Watson and American scientist Francis Crick utilized Rosalind Franklin's image of DNA, captured using x-ray crystallography. Franklin's discovery that DNA had a helical conformation prompted Watson and Crick to come up with a double-stranded helical model of DNA. Additionally, they discovered that DNA was made up of two chains of nucleotides, and that nitrogenous bases can have several combinations. With the discovery of the double-helix model, the two scientists formulated a defining list of features. For one, the two distinct polynucleotide chains wrapped around an axis to form a double helix and that the two chains ran in opposite directions.
