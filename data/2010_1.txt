PacBio sequencing
>Text:
PacBio sequencing technique has allowed for longer read lights to be calculated. The machine takes a sample of any type. Firstly, single strands of DNA and RNA are taken. Adapters are then placed on either side of the DNA or RNA, creating a circular template. Polymerases and Primers are added for sequencing purposes. All this occurs at the center of the machine, the SMART cell. This contains small holes where single strands of DNA with the adapters, and polymerases are placed. The polymerase works to connect labeled nucleotides, which causes light to be emitted.
