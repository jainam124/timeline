HGPâ€™s human genetic mapping goal achieved
>Text:
The Human Genome Project was attempting to tackle the development of a detailed map of the human genome. The use of a genetic map became a vital part of what scientists used to detect genes responsible for a disease. These new findings allowed scientists to detect which chromosome possessed a particular gene and where it was in that chromosome. Scientists found that when a genetic marker is inherited with a disease gene, that gene is near the genetic marker.
