HGPâ€™s human genetic mapping goal achieved
>Text:
A goal that the Human Genome Project was attempting to tackle was to develop a detailed map of the human genome. Using a genetic map became a vital part of what scientists used to detect genes responsible for a disease. The new results allowed scientists to detect what chromosome possessed a particular gene and where it was in that chromosome. Scientists found that when a genetic marker is inherited with a disease gene, that gene is near the genetic marker.
