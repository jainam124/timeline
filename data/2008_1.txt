$1,000 genome project
>Text:
Many scientists and researchers found that sequencing genomes was an extremely expensive and time-consuming process. A leading company in biotechnology, Illumina, introduced technology to sequence the DNA in a human cell for $1,000. The machine consisted of a combination of ten different machines called HiSeq X and was the first system capable of sequencing a genome for only $1,000. With a cheaper method of sequencing human DNA, scientists were able to produce better drugs and diagnostic tests. HiSeq X breaks down DNA into small fragments and then attaches DNA fragment adopters to these fragments. The DNA and adopters are then placed into a sodium hydroxide solution.
