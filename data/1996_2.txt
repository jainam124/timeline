Mouse HGP achieved
>Text:
Researchers worked to find animals that had a similar genetic code to that of human beings. With more extensive research, it was found that the DNA of a mouse was similar to that of a human. A map produced by Eric Lander, a researcher from MIT, used approximately 7,377 markers. There was 1 marker for every 400,000 nucleotide base. The new map provided insights into all 20 mouse chromosomes. Overall, this map provided a deeper look into the genetic makeup of a mouse. The findings showed that there was an 85% similarity between the genetic information of a mouse and a human. This meant that scientists were able to conduct experiments on mice and observe the results, before attempting it on human subjects.
