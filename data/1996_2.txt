Mouse HGP achieved
>Text:
Researchers worked to find animals that have similar genetics to that of humans. With more extensive research, scientists found that the DNA of a mouse is similar to that of a human's. A map produced by Eric Lander, a researcher from MIT, used approximately 7,377 markers. There was 1 marker for every 400,000 nucleotide base. The new map provided insights into all 20 chromosomes that a mouse has. Overall, this map provided a deeper look at the genetic makeup of a mouse. The findings showed that there was an 85% similarity between the genetic information of a mouse and a human. This meant that scientists were able to conduct more experiments on mice and observe the results before attempting it on human beings.
