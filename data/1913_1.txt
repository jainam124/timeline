Alfred Sturtevant and Thomas Morgan makes first linear map of genes 
>Text:
For years prior to 1913, many scientists weren’t able to fully extend their knowledge, in terms of determining where a specific gene is located to a particular region of a chromosome. Alfred Sturtevant was puzzled about how to find some sort of innovation that would make this possible. In 1913, Alfred Sturtevant and Thomas Morgan developed the first gene map with the use of the fruit fly Drosophila. They watched as a fly’s offspring's eye colours and wings size varied. Sometimes it appeared as though one of their parents while the other had a combination of both parents. Alfred Sturtevant then suggested that the frequency of crossover can approximate the distance between genes. Furthermore, with this idea in mind, they formulated a map that is now used globally by scientists to accurately determine where a gene is located, in terms of the region of a chromosome.
