Johannes Friedrich Miescher extracts DNA
>Text:
At this point, scientists had already begun working out the concepts of heredity and evolution that were credited to the contributions of Charles Darwin and Gregor Mendel. However, scientists were still in search of answers regarding the question of what the building blocks of life could be. Friedrich Miescher, a Swiss medical researcher and former physician, began working under biochemist Felix Hoppe-Seyler’s lab and focused his research on leukocytes (white blood cells). <p>He used samples of pus from fresh surgical bandages to conduct his experiment. He began by separating the leukocytes from the bandages, and then isolating the nuclei by treating the leukocyte with a diluted sodium sulfate solution, hydrochloric acid solution, and sodium carbonate solution.  He found that the substance he isolated contained high amounts of phosphorus and lacked sulfur, signifying that it was a novel molecule and not any type of protein. He termed this substance “nuclein”, which would form the basis of nucleoproteins and nucleic acids.</p> After Miescher published his findings on nuclein, it garnered very little attention and it took many years for the scientific world to accept nuclein as a carrier of genetic information. Miescher’s crude purification of DNA set the groundwork for the molecular discoveries which would follow during the 1940s and 1950s.
