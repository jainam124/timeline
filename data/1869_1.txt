Johannes Friedrich Miescher extracts DNA
>Text:
At this point, the concepts of heredity and evolution were credited to the contributions of Charles Darwin and Gregor Mendel, but the question of the composition of the building blocks of life remained. Friedrich Miescher, a Swiss medical researcher and former physician, began working under biochemist Felix Hoppe-Seyler studying leukocytes (white blood cells). <p>Miescher used pus samples from fresh surgical bandages to conduct his experiments. He began by separating the leukocytes from the bandages and isolating the nuclei by treating the leukocyte with a diluted sodium sulfate solution, hydrochloric acid solution, and sodium carbonate solution.  He found that the substance he isolated contained high amounts of phosphorus, but lacked sulfur; this signified that the substance was a novel molecule. He termed this substance “nuclein”; a mixture of DNA and protein.</p> After Miescher published his findings on nuclein, it garnered very little attention. However, Miescher’s crude purification of DNA set the groundwork for the molecular discoveries that would follow during the 1940s and 1950s.
