Human genome project launched
>Text:
Advancements in genetics and biotechnology set forth an ambitious project to map the entire human genome. The Human Genome Project was brought to the attention of the U.S. Academy of Sciences. It would later be adopted by the National Institutes of Health and Department of Energy, and subsequently funded by the government. 
	 At first, the scientific world was skeptical of the feasibility of this project, as its cost could outweigh its benefits. The Human Genome Project aimed to identify all of the approximately 20,500 genes in human DNA, determine the sequences of chemical base pairs that make up human DNA, store all of the information in databases, address ethical issues that may arise, and improve data analysis tools. The Human Genome Project would take many more years to finish, but its founding marked the beginning of one of humanity's greatest scientific achievements and would require an international collaborative effort.
