Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS)
>Text:
The Next-Generation Sequencing method (NGS) allowed scientists to sequence the whole human genome in a single day. This new technology revolutionized biological science. Until now, researchers were still using Sangerâ€™s sequencing method. Additionally, NGS has enabled scientists to perform DNA and RNA sequencing at a lower cost, with biological systems being examined more efficiently.
