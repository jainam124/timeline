Chromosomes occur in pairs and are sex-determining
>Text: Elanor Carothers, a known American zoologist and geneticist was a student studying under C. E. McClung at the University of Kansas when she discovered that the independent assortment of sex chromosomes occurred in grasshoppers. Specifically, she found that the X chromosome was followed by another large chromosome in 51.3% of cases or a small chromosome in 48.6% of cases. Another student studying under C. E. McClung named Walter Sutton was studying grasshoppers and he incorrectly concluded that female grasshoppers had 22 chromosomes, leading C. E. McClung to deduce that the X chromosome was male determining. This student went on to publish the Boveri-Sutton chromosome theory of inheritance (Boveri proposed the same theory independently) in 1902 concluding that chromosomes were linear structures where genes resided at certain loci and that the laws of Mendelian genetics could be correctly applied to chromosomes. It was Nettie Stevens who settled the confusion around sex chromosomes, after studying Tenebrio, a species of beetle, she deduced that XX chromosomes determined the female sex and XY chromosomes determined the male sex.
