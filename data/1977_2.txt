Sanger Sequencing 
>Text:
The inventor of Sanger sequencing, Fredrick Sanger won a Nobel prize in 1977 for his work on the development of this novel DNA sequencing technique. The technique involves the incorporation of chain-terminating dideoxynucleotides (ddNTPs), which come in 4 versions resembling the 4 nucleotides in DNA (ddATP, ddCTP, ddGTP, ddTTP), and 4 standard dNTPs (dATP, dCTP, dGTP, dTTP) which do not terminate the strand.
